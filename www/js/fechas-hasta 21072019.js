// version: 2
// adaptado de fechas.csv, según las instrucciones del final de este archivo, más:
// añadir línea 7 (var fechas=[) y otra final (]). Sustituir ("[," por [) y (",]," por ],) a cada línea.  
// sustituyo 'español' por 'es', y 'english' por 'en'
// no se pueden usar exactamente todos los mismos campos que en App Inventor, hay que comentar los que no sirven
// y hay que añadir campos nuevos, como las tabs
